Using [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), a container orchestration service, and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) as the platform for containers. Using this Kubernetes, I am able to deploy a service that is easy to scale and reliable. The Docker image that I used is the [docker-pets](https://github.com/dockersamples/docker-pets), which hosts a web page that displays images of pets. On the website it also shows which container is hosting the web page, making it a good demo to show the scalability of Docker contianers. 

## How I did it
First download the [docker-pets](https://github.com/dockersamples/docker-pets) image, or using the command `git clone https://github.com/dockersamples/docker-pets.git`

Next, start minikube using `minikube start` and enter the Docker environment using `minikube docker-env` and `minikube docker-env | Invoke-Expression`
