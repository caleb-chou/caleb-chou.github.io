Set up a server which can host dedicated servers for games to play with friends without needing to be on the same LAN. Using the router's control panel, I forwarded ports to allow connections on specific ports. Also, I was able to forward ports to allow me to RDP into my home pc, giving me access to the computing horsepower if I need it when I'm not at home.

On the router control panel, there are many different options to when it comes to what ports to forward and what devices to forward them to. Based on which service I need, such as different games, different ports are opened by the services.
